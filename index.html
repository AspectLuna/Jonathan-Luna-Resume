        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Film and Digital Production</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Filmwork: As a film major I have exceeded my own expectations as to what was possible for someone who had never taken a film course.
       I have been able to work with local studios producing a short series on youtube, have been in talks with Sony Pictures for an internship, and have gone to numerous film festivals around Los Angeles.
       Two of my biggest accomplishments thus far have been the invitation to the Emerging Cinematographer Awards in 2022 as well as currently working on my own feature film entitled "When The Sun Rises in the West".
       My time of graduation from UCR is projected at 2025, though I have faced many academic challenges my goal still remains to graduate and continue my filmmaking career no matter the circumstances I may face.
       Though my time as a filmmaker has been short by comparison to other esteemed individuals in the industry, I hope to bring new ways to tell stories as well as new stories to tell.<br><br>

       Life Experiences: Life has it's ways of showing everyone new lessons, sometimes it may be a small lesson with not many ramifications, but other times it may be at the cost of something.
       In 2021 I learned how fickle life could be, my father lost his job, two of my friends passed away, and more shockingly was the moment I almost died in an accident. Nothing in my 17 years of life could have prepared me for all of those tribulations.
       I suffered from survivors guilt, one of my friends had suffered an almost exact accident that took his life yet he passed away. Through all of this I learned how we were never guaranteed tomorrow, that all experiences we share with others may be our last.
       It made me grateful for many of the things in my life but that lesson also taught me to slow down because life will come at you very fast, but slowing down and learning new things is what can make this life a little more bearable.<br><br>

        Ideals and Ambitions: Ideals are the principles or values that guide us in life. 
        They are the fundamental beliefs and standards we uphold and strive to live by. 
        Personally, I believe in ideals such as honesty, compassion, and continuous growth. 
        I strive to be an individual who embodies integrity, treating others with kindness and empathy, while constantly seeking opportunities to learn and improve myself.
        Ambitions, on the other hand, are the goals and aspirations we set for ourselves.
        They are the dreams and desires that drive us forward, pushing us to achieve more and make a meaningful impact.
        In my case, my primary ambition is to provide helpful and insightful information to those who interact with me as well as help out my family by buying them a new house and providing them the necessities they may need once I and my sister have graduated and moved away,.
        I also aspire to assist others who may seek the same knowledge I do and help them cultivate and find ways to make it uniquely their own. 
        In a industry such as film having some sort of mentor or mentee can help with collaboration and further growth not only between the person asking the questions but also those who provide the answers.
